# Creative Alphabet Patterns in Python

This notebook demonstrates how to generate and display patterns of letters from A to Z using Python. Each letter is represented as a unique pattern created through nested loops and conditional statements.

## Features

- Generate patterns for all uppercase alphabet letters.
- User-friendly input to display personalized name patterns.
- Utilizes Python functions and match statements for clear organization.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open the notebook in your preferred Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
3. Run the code cells to generate the alphabet patterns.
4. Enter a name when prompted to see its corresponding letter patterns.

## Example

When you enter the name "Alice," the output will display the patterns for the letters A, L, I, C, and E.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
